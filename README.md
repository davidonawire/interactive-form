# Interactive Form with Validation

Uses unobtrusive vanilla JavaScript to add dynamic interactivity to a form, real-time validation, as well as final validation on submit. For example, t-shirt color options do not appear unless a t-shirt theme has been selected, and payment info changes depending on the payment method selected. Activities with conflicting times can't be selected simultaneously, and a total cost for activities is dynamically displayed.

To submit the form, name, email, and, if selected, credit card info must all be filled out correctly, as well as at least one activity chosen.
